 ##### Conditionals and recursion
The **modulus operator**
In C++, the modulus operator is a percent sign, %.

Conditional execution.
The simplest form is the if statement:
```C++
if(x > 0) { 
cout << "x is positive" << endl;
}
```
The return statement allows you to terminate the execution of a function before you reach the end.
