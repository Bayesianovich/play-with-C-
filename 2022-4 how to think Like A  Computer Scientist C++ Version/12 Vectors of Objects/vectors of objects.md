Having seen this pattern, and having learned about vectors and objects, you should not be surprised to learn that you can have vectors of objects.In fact, you can also **have objects that contain vectors (as instance variables)**; you can **have vectors that contain vectors**; you can **have objects that contain objects**, and so on

**encode**: To represent one set of values using another set of values, by constructing a mapping between them.

**abstract parameter**: A set of parameters that act together as a single parameter.
